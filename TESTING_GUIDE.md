# 🧪 Testing Guide - No Backend Required

## Quick Start Testing

You can now test **all frontend pages** without a backend implementation using mock data!

## 🚀 How to Test

### **Option 1: Test Page (Easiest)**

1. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   make frontend-up
   # or
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to test page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test
   ```

3. **Click any page button** to test with mock data automatically loaded

### **Option 2: Manual Flow**

1. **Enable mock mode** on test page
2. **Navigate through normal flow**:
   - `/landing` → Click "Start Your First Interview"
   - `/upload` → Upload any file + enter any job URL → Click "Continue"
   - `/ready` → Review mock data → Click "Start Interview"
   - `/interview` → Will show UI (WebSocket will fail but page loads)
   - `/results` → View mock results with full analysis
   - `/dashboard` → View mock interview history

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"WebSocket connection failed"**
**Expected** - Backend not running. Pages will still load and show UI.

### **"MongoDB URI not set"**
**Expected** - Auth features require MongoDB. Pages work without it.

### **"Failed to process data"**
**Solution**: Enable mock mode on `/test` page first

### **"Page shows no data"**
**Solution**: 
1. Go to `/test`
2. Click the page button (not just navigate)
3. Mock data will be loaded automatically
